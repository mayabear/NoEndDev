  <h1>The teacher read a quote to her students from Silent Spring. </h1>

  <h2>
    “We stand now where two roads diverge.
    But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's familiar poem, they are not equally fair.
     The other fork of the road — the one less traveled by — offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth.” The bell rings and the class is dismissed.

     The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster.
