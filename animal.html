  <h1>As soon as she spotted the bird animals, Margarite felt the air change. </h1>

  <h2>
     Horrible noises replaced the birdsong sound of wildlife.
     A factory farm stood before her, with trucks bringing feed to the animals.
     The air was thick with pollution.
     <br>
     <br>
    She walked to the entrance of the factory and saw too many animals, all crowded in and restrained.
    “What is this?” she asked the creature. “What happened?”
    <br>
    The creature leaned against the dirty walls. “You happened, Margarite. You and everyone around you, making decisions every day.”
