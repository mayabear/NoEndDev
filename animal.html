  <h1>As soon as she spotted the bird animals, Margarite felt the air change. </h1>

  <h2>
     Horrible noises replaced the birdsong sound of wildlife.
     A factory farm stood before her, with trucks bringing feed to the animals.
     The air was thick with pollution.

    She walked to the entrance of the factory and saw too many animals, all crowded in and restrained.
    “What is this?” she asked the creature. “What happened?”
    <br>
    The creature leaned against the dirty walls. “You happened, Margarite. You and everyone around you, making decisions every day.”
