  <h1>As soon as her toes touched the water, Margarite felt the air change. </h1>

  <h2>
    Horrible smells replaced the floral aromas. She looked around her to find the
    river and forest were gone, the trees cut, and the birds silent. The brook around her flowed with litter.
     Trees swayed in the wind, a brook burbled, and wildlife was all around her.
     Margarite was overwhelmed.
     <br>
     <br>
    She was in a crater, below where the forest used to be, and surrounded by all sorts of garbage.
    “What is this?” she asked the creature.“This isn’t the forest river.”
    <br>
    “Anymore,” said the creature, who sat on a heap of plastic looking out on the horizon.
    <br>
    “You happened, Margarite. You and everyone around you, making decisions every day.”
